It's an Open source initiative of JECRC University.
COSEC is all about to encourage students to contribute to open source projects and providing students with tools and education they need to advance their skills. Our goals are to raise awareness towards increased education and enlighten the knowledge of what, why and how to contribute to open source projects. One key initiative for COSEC is to foster the skillset of students through practical education. Our mission is to connecting students to the best open source activities on the web. Club Members will develop new skills, contribute to innovative web technologies, and be part of a powerful network of students and professionals, dedicated to keeping the web a public resource, open and accessible to all.
